# Attention Half-Life — plan

The one plan document for this project. Appended per session. A second document about a
mark that already has one means the dress is not settled: go back to the theme step.

Research lives in `research/source.md` (provenance) and `research/findings.md` (the ranked
inventory, the kill list and the ledger). This file is decisions, not evidence.

## Session 1 — 2026-08-30 · MINE

Everything previously built on this dataset was deleted at Dustin's instruction and the run
restarted at step 1. The two frozen extracts survive; nothing about how they were once drawn
does. Commit `131e722`.

**Done**

- `research/source.md` filled before a number was derived. Two independent pulls against the
  same API, and they disagree by 23% on the same event because one counts users and the
  other counts all agents. The rule written down: one figure, one agent basis, named on the
  page.
- The selection effect recorded at the top of both research files: **the 220 rows are a
  gate, not a sample**, and "rose then decayed" is the definition of the set. Every finding
  is tested on day -1 and day +180 to +340, which the gate never reads.
- 7 findings ranked, 3 leads killed, every hunt-list shape checked.
- Provenance restored to a runnable state: `scripts/build-census.js` had been orphaned by
  the wipe, so `src/lib/census.js` and `pageviews.js` came back and `API_START` moved out of
  the deleted `classify.js`. The fetch is documented and re-runnable; it must not be re-run.

**Numbers checked against the files, not trusted**

A verification pass over every figure in `findings.md` **failed three of them** and they were
corrected in the record: minimum lift is 0.14 and not 0.1; ten rows have a lift under 1.0 and
not six; forty-five rows are already climbing before day -21 and not forty. The guard was
left alone. That is the mechanism working, at step 1, before anything was built on it.

**The spine**

F1: warning under 2% of the peak settles at **1.33x** its own old level a year later, 65% of
them higher; warning over 25% settles at **0.49x**, 30% higher. z 4.397, p 1.1e-5. It holds
across three before-windows and three after-windows, 9 of 9 at p ≤ 0.0007, and it survives
dropping every row whose baseline was already climbing (p 0.0020). Warning is not a proxy for
prior fame (log-log r 0.356).

**Open, and deliberately not decided this session**

- No theme sentence. No palette. No mark beyond the one named per finding in the inventory.
- F7 is ranked **low** and may be killed at step 2: 10 points, r 0.610, and it cannot be
  separated from Wikipedia's own traffic growth with this extract.
- F6 needs a null model over year, month and weekday before its count becomes a claim.
- The personal hook has no candidate that works on 220 rows. It is a step-3 interaction
  question, not a finding.

**Next: step 2, guard.** One `pipeline/` pass per mining pass, emitting the payload and
asserting every number above against this record. Nothing is built until `npm run data`
exits 0.

**Converted: 0 of 7.**
